<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Calaveras State Park Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]

This project was created as a course assignment in CGT 353 in which we had to build an interactive and dynamic site of our choice within a team. My team and I chose to recreate a California state park with a newer, modern design.

As state and national parks in the United States have a simplistic, consistent appearance across all parks, we wanted to create a more specialized experience to attract visitors. We wanted to provide a unique experience to visitors where they could observe photos of their destination as well as factual information.

### Built With
* [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
